    <h2>Flute</h2>
</center>
  <section>
    <center>
  <p>The Flute is a woodwind instrument, even though it's body is made of metal.<br>
  The assembly is very easy for this instrument. Some video's will be provided on the assembly and scales.<br>
  You want to try to hold the Flute at a 90 degree angle the best you can.<br>
  Some band directors get very picky about the angle your holding your Flute.<br>
  The Flute is small and light weight, so it is really easy to hold.<br>
  Flutes usually have melody, as their range is very high.<br>
  You must have good wind support and good posture for the higher notes.<br>
  <h2>Clarinet</h2>
  <p>The Clarinet is also light weight. You want to hold this instrument down, at a slight angle, in between your legs.<br>
  The Clarinet cannot rest on your leg, or the chair.<br>
  Clarinets usually have harmony and melody since they can reach two octaves.<br>
  But keep in mind, you also have to have good wind support and good posture to get a good sonding high note.<br>
  In my experiences in band, the clarinets who take on the challenge of reaching the higher octaves don't sound that good.<br>
  Some signs that your high octave notes aren't sounding good is that the notes will sound windy.<br>
  This is either because of wind support, or a damaged key.<br>
  Also, Clarinets can easily squeak, and it does not sound pretty.<br>
  This is also the embarrassing moments at concerts for beginners and even some of the higher classes.<br></p>
  <h2>Trombone</h2>
  <p>Trombones are a bit heavier then most of the instruments.<br>
    This instrument is the bass of most music.<br>
    You will hear some of the low brass complain that they hardly every get melody.<br>
    But when they do, it sounds amazing.<br>
    Trombones can also reach two octaves, but this is completely different from most og the instruments.<br>
    Trombones have a slide instead of keys.<br>
    With this in mind, you'll learn the different slide postitions.<br>
    The slide posititons go from 1-7.<br>
    If you do not match up with a position, you'll hear a weird note.<br>
    But, the downside is that if you have fast tempo songs, or eighth notes, be prepared to move your arm quickly.<br>
    This is usually where the weird notes come out.<br>
    You want to be decent at the slide positions and have it memorized so you can remember how far to go.<br>
    The Trombone rests on your shoulder, so over the years, it will create a small arc in the metal.<br>
    This maybe could affect your sound.<br>
    And also, this instrument does not have a reed.<br>
    You instead have a metal mouthpiece.<br></p>
<h2>Alto Saxophone</h2>
  <p>The Alto Saxophone is easier to hold then you think.<br>
      The Saxophone can rest at your side, or like the clarinet.<br>
      Band directors prefer you to hold it like a clarinet, but I find it easier to hold off to the side.<br>
      The Alto Saxophone can reach two octaves as well, technically 3!<br>
      The note memorization is really easy for this instrument.<br>
      Alto's usually have harmony.<br>
      In certain songs, they will get melody for sadly only a few meassures.<br>
      Also, Alto Saxophones are common in Jazz music.<br>
      Though this instrument requires many steps to put it together, it is one of the most easiest to learn.<br>
      Sometimes Alto's will sometimes even hit some base notes depending on the song.<br>
      But, they are constantly out of tune.<br>
      You can tell this by using a tuner or tuner app and playing an F-Sharp with the octave key.<br>
      This will read either flat or sharp, and it's really difficult to make it a perfect tune.<br>
      Sometimes the mouthpiece will be pushed on the cork too far.<br>
      This will read as Sharp.<br>
      If the mouthpiece is not on far enough, then it will raad flat.<br>
      Posture and wind support are also needed to make a good sound.<br>
      I personally have been picked on a lot by my band director due to my Saxophone being Sharp.<br></p>
    <h2>Trumpet</h2>
  <p>The trumpet is... a difficult instrument to learn. Instead of keys or a slide, you have 3 valves that play different notes based on the fingerings.<br>
  And the trumpets are usually the loudest in the band, and they won't quiet down most of the time.<br>
  Band directors get very picky on how you hold your trumpet.<br>
  You have to hold it up at an angle, and you have to push the buttons with your finger tips.<br></p>
