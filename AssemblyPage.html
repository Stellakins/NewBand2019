        <h2>Assembly For Alto Saxophone</h2>
          <p>An Alto Saxophone Assembly is really easy once you get the hang of it.
            The assembly will roughly take around 5 minutes once you have done this for awhile.</p>
          <h2>Step 1: Neckstrap</h2>
        <p>Step one is getting the instrumet out of the case and putting on the neckstrap.<br>
      You want to attach the neckstrap to a little loop that's on the Saxophone as shown in the picture provided.<br>
    Once you have the neckstrap attached to the Alto Saxophone, then you can put it around your neck.<br>
  You can do this step Vise Versa, meaning oppisite, or however you find it easier.</p>
    <h2>Step 2: Neck</h2>
      <p>Once you have the body of the Alto Saxophone attached and is around your neck, you want to carefully take out the neck of the instrument.<br>
        This piece could easily bend and break, so be very careful when you attach it.<br>
          You want to take the neck of the instrument and attaach it to the top of your Saxophone. There is a little screw off to the side that you must loosen first.<br>
            Once you attach the neck, tighten the screw back up. If you don't, the neck could easily de-attach from the instrument doing rehearsel or during a performance.<br>
              <h2>Step 3: Mouthpiece, Ligature, and Reeds</h2>
            <p>Get your mouthpiece, ligature, and box of reeds out of your case, and the cork grease.
          Apply the cork grease to the cork of the neck.<br>
        Once that is applied, you can easily get the mouthpiece on.<br>
      Once you get the mouthpiece on in the required spot it needs to be, then you can put the reed on.<br>
    Usually beginner reeds start at 2.0 strength.<br>
  You only need one reed.<br>
    Aline the reed to the center of the reed. The video provided will explain this step in further details.<br>
      Now, untighten the ligature and carefully slide your ligature over the reed and mouthpiece.<br>
        You want to be careful, because you can split your reed by hitting the ligature against the reed.<br>

            <h2>Assembly For Trumpet</h2>
              <p>The Trumpet only has 2 pieces to put together. It is one of the easiest instruments for quick and easy assembly, but very complicated to learn.<br>
            All you need to do is take the body out of the case, and attach the mouthpiece.<br>
          If your valves are tough to push down, or they are sticking, then you need to use your valve oil.<br>
        The vavle oil helps loosen the buttons so they won't stick.</p>

    <h2>Assembly For Flute</h2>
  <p>The Flute is also very easy to assemble, but very complicated to learn.<br>
It is simply three attachments, but you have to be very gentle and careful.<br>
  You have to make sure the attachments are aligned correctly, or else you could bend a piece of your instrument.<br>
    Then you have to adjust your headjoint to the position for you to be able to play it.</p>
      <img class="clarinetclass" src="images/ClarinetAssembly.jpg">
        <h2>Assembly For Clarinet</h2>
          <p>This instrument is going to be in steps just like the Alto Saxophone, for this instrument has many pieces.</p><br>
            <h2>Step One: Attaching The Upper And Lower Tubes</h2>
          <p>First, you want to take the upper and lower tubes out of the case.<br>
        Before you attach your Upper and Lower Tube, apply a bit of cork grease.<br>
      You want to carefully allign and attach these pieces together.<br>
    If they are not alligned properly, then you risk breaking your instrument.</p><br>
  <h2>Step 2: Attaching The Bell</h2>
    <p>Next, you want to take out the bell and carefully attach it to the lower tube.<br>
      You want to make sure the brand name of the Clarinet is facing outward/the front of the instrument.</p><br>
        <h2>Step 3: Attaching The BarrelLigature, Mouthpiece, And Reed</h2>
          <p>Next, you want to get your mouthpiece and barrel out of the case.<br>
              Apply cork grease to the cork at the top of the Upper Tube.<br>
                Carefully put the barrel on the top of the Upper Tube.<br>
              Now, allign your reed with your mouthpiece and slide the ligature over both of them.<br>
            You want to make sure that you loosen the screws on the ligature.<br>
          Omce you have the ligature over both the moughtpiece and the ligature, tighten up the screws.<br>
        Next, apply cork grease to your mouthpiece.<br>
      Like the Alto Saxophone mouthpiece, this will help it not get stuck, or too difficult to put on.<br>
    Once you have that done, you are ready to play!</p><br>

<h2>Assembly For Trombone</h2>
  <p>This instrument doesn't require much time to put together.<br>
    It is a quick instrument to put together and a bit easy to learn.<br>
      First, you want to take out the Bell Section of the instrument.<br>
        The tuning slide should already be attached to the trombone.<br>
          Next, you want to take out the slide, or as some call in, the main tuning slide.<br>
            Simply slide on the main tuning slide over the inner slide.<br>
          Finally, attach your mouthpiece and you are set!</p><br>
        <img class="percussionclass" src="images/BellKitAssembly.jpg">
      <h2>Bell Kits</h2>
    <p>Bell Kits are a bit difficult to set up. So read these steps to help you out!</p><br>
  <h2>Step One: Bell Stand</h2>
<p>When you open your case, first take out the bell kit stand.<br>
  This will hold your Xylophone and Drum Pad.<br>
    Adjust the screws so that you can extend the legs of the stand, and so you can adjust the height.<br>
      Tighten up the screws once you get it to where you need it to be.</p><br>
        <h2>Step 2: Placing On The Xylophone Or Drum Pad</h2>
          <p>You want to center your drumpad or Xylophone on your stamd. This should be easy to do.</p><br>
