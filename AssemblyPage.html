<h2>Assembly For Alto Saxophone</h2>
<p>An Alto Saxophone Assembly is really easy once you get the hang of it.
The assembly will roughly take around 5 minutes once you have done this for awhile.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Neckstrap</h2>
<p>Step one is getting the instrumet out of the case and putting on the neckstrap.
You want to attach the neckstrap to a little loop that's on the Saxophone as shown in the picture provided.
Once you have the neckstrap attached to the Alto Saxophone, then you can put it around your neck.
You can do this step Vise Versa, meaning oppisite, or however you find it easier.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Neck</h2>
<p>Once you have the body of the Alto Saxophone attached and is around your neck, you want to carefully take out the neck of the instrument.
This piece could easily bend and break, so be very careful when you attach it.
You want to take the neck of the instrument and attaach it to the top of your Saxophone. There is a little screw off to the side that you must loosen first.
Once you attach the neck, tighten the screw back up. If you don't, the neck could easily de-attach from the instrument doing rehearsel or during a performance.
<h2>Step 3: Mouthpiece, Ligature, and Reeds</h2>
<p>Get your mouthpiece, ligature, and box of reeds out of your case, and the cork grease.
  Apply the cork grease to the cork of the neck.
  Once that is applied, you can easily get the mouthpiece on.
  Once you get the mouthpiece on in the required spot it needs to be, then you can put the reed on.
  Usually beginner reeds start at 2.0 strength.
  You only need one reed.
  Aline the reed to the center of the reed. The video provided will explain this step in further details.
  Now, untighten the kigature and carefully slide your ligature over the reed and mouthpiece.
  You want to be careful, because you can split your reed by hitting the ligature against the reed.
